## Introduction

In this lab, I will demonstrate how to install and configure Zeek and Suricata on Ubuntu 22.04 server. These tools provide in-depth network traffic analysis and intrusion detection capabilities, which are essential for our defensive monitoring stack.

As part of the setup, I will configure a static IP address for the server to ensure it is on the same network topology as the rest of the lab environment. Our pfSense firewall will also play a central role in managing and routing traffic. By combining pfSense with Zeek and Suricata, we significantly enhance our visibility, allowing us to capture, analyze, and detect suspicious activities more effectively.

# Zeek & Suricata Installation and Configuration Guide

### Install Zeek:

Add Zeek repository

The Zeek installation has been completed, and its binaries are located as shown below. To customize Zeek, its uses this configuration file provided, we are going to install and enable the folowing:

Installs Zeek (with JA3 & JA4 fingerprinting enabled)

#

### Install Suricata
![suricata-img](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0101e713-d5fb-4297-854d-ae1dcc8ac450)

### Configure Suricata

Edit the YAML config:

Community IDs are intended to provide a predictable flow ID for records that can be used to match them to the output of other tools, such as Zeek.

![suricata-yaml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7884ade3-5fdc-4f63-855d-e0b03786d23d)

### Update Rules

Enable additional rules:
![update-rule1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e96f042-49e4-48dd-8abd-56c121a00be8)
![update-rule2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b59789-6574-44e8-a9b5-a0b7edc7dabd)

### Start Suricata
![suricata-start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c82c1cf-26fe-47c0-84fd-c075239b3620)

### Validate config
![validate-config](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12cf5229-d0c1-480f-81bc-e6060817e02b)

#

# Add Custom Sliver C2 Rules

### Fetch custom rule: 
![custom-rule1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e6bc590-fc3a-4119-ad0b-ba44ecd190bc)

### Append it to rules and Verify rule addition:
![apend-rule](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b8bfc4-4716-4844-a806-6995052f661e)

### Now both Zeek and Suricata are installed, configured, and ready for investigation

# Setting Static IP Address and Default Route:

 - Configured a static IP address for the Zeek-Suricata server and defined a default route with the gateway 192.168.1.1. `sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`

![zeek-static-ip1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/786bbfb7-a020-4553-b18c-12302b9e0c87)

Apply the changes: `sudo netplan apply`

# Zeek-Suricata + Splunk UF Setup

Iâ€™m grabbing the Splunk Universal Forwarder .deb file. I'll show a roundabout way through a TinyURL to install the file on the server and rename it as a habit with Splunk.

![splunk-deb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ec151a5-12de-4efa-9e24-b20882a45848)

### Setting UP Splunk Universal Forwarder:

Change into the forwarder binary, switch to the splunkforwarder user, start it, and accept the license. I set the username to admin and a secure password. Exit the splunkforwarder user, and then change to the binary to enable boot-start.

![splunkfwd-image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8fd5368-33ae-4145-b14f-173f36983c2a)

### Point this UF to the Splunk indexer

![splunkfwd-active](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75e4dd73-481c-473b-82c8-20a01a359c71)

We now see an active forwarding going to the Splunk server. Finally, this is how we configure Splunk on the Zeek server to point our data over to our Splunk server.
